- You should know how to commit

- Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like version control because I can experiment with my files or try new things without the fear of losing previous work.

I dont like the extra steps needed to push, pull, and manage conflicts, as it can be time consuming and requires a lot of diligence.
